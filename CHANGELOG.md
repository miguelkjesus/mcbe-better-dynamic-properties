# Changelog

## Version 0.2.0

Already thought of a few things that I really should've added originally, so here's a quick update.

### Added

- `.exists()` which checks the existance of a property.

### Changed

- `.adjusts()` now returns the adjusted value of the property.
- Serialized values can now be any valid dynamic property value, not just a string. (affects `.serialized` and `.)
- .`ids()`, `.values()`, and `.entries()` now take "namespace" as an option.

## Version 0.1.0

Package release! :D
